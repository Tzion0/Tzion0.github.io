# Arriving in Korea (June 18)
We arrived at Seoul Incheon International Airport on the morning of June 18 and met FazeCT ([@FazeCT1512](https://twitter.com/FazeCT1512)) there. Shortly after, we took a bus from Seoul to Sejong.

The weather was cool, and the area wasn’t very crowded. There were bicycles everywhere, but unfortunately, we couldn’t use them as they were not available for foreigners.

For dinner, we had delicious chicken at [Dokgama Charcoal Chicken Sejong Eojin Branch](https://naver.me/GJT0cev9). We had planned to join the Vietnamese teams in the same restaurant, but it was full that time. We did meet a late-arriving Vietnamese player ([@th3_5had0w_w](https://twitter.com/th3_5had0w_w)) and had dinner together.

The advanced category competition was intense. I solved several reverse engineering and forensics challenges. We didn’t leave many challenges unsolved, so it became a race against time and we finished in 12th place. Initially, we thought we might leave many forensics challenges unsolved, but we managed to solve most of them. I also avoided my usual careless mistakes, and our teammates even solved a tricky challenge. A memorable moment was when Ren and I solved a reverse engineering challenge together by making educated guesses, which turned out to be correct.

Later, we had dinner with the Singapore teams, most of whom were from GCC2024, and then took a chilly walk back to the hotel.

# Award Ceremony (June 20)
This was the day of the awards ceremony. Before that, there were talks on the unsolved challenges by their creators. Although I couldn’t understand everything, even with the translator device, but kinda got the gist of it.

After the ceremony, we took a bus back to Seoul Incheon International Airport. With the remaining hours before our return flight, we explored Myeong-dong street and treated ourselves to a nice Dak-galbi dinner.
