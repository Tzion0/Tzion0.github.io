Over the past five months, I've taken several INE certifications without taking their courses. In this blog post, I won't focus on how to prepare for each certification since many reviews already cover that. Instead, I'll share some key points and things to watch out for when attempting the exams.

# eJPT (Junior Penetration Tester)
This is one of the most popular certifications offered by INE, and the exam environment is incredibly smooth like butter. I highly recommend taking it.

# eWPT (Web Application Penetration Tester)
The exam environment is also stable and runs smoothly, just like the eJPT.

# eCTHPv2 (Certified Threat Hunting Professional)
No complaints on this one. The exam environment is smooth as well.

# eMAPT (Mobile Application Penetration Tester)
There have been some complaints in the INE Community Forums about people's exploits working during testing but failing the exam. My advice is make sure your exploit is fully automated to avoid such issues.

# eWPTXv2 (Web Application Penetration Tester eXtreme)
I'm taking version 2 of this exam because I missed the exchange period for version 3, which was released a few months ago. In version 2, you're required to submit a pentest report, but version 3 switched to an MCQ format and doesn't require a report. Overall, it's a good exam, though the exam environment can occasionally be unstable.

# eEDA (Enterprise Defense Administrator)
Take note that crucial information, such as credentials, can be found in the lab description. However, this information will disappear once you start the exam lab, which was a frustrating experience for me. I ended up wasting an attempt because of that. Make sure to check the lab description carefully and take note of it before starting.

# eCPPTv3 (Certified Professional Penetration Tester)
Hear me out, All you need from the Letter of Engagement or guide is the **target scope**. After you get that, feel free to delete the guide.

**Don't trust everything in the guide**

**Don't trust everything in the guide**

**Don't trust everything in the guide**

This includes not relying on the recommended wordlists specified in the guide. All the information you need is typically in the `~/Desktop` directory, including wordlists, Neo4j credentials, etc.

# eCDFP (Certified Digital Forensics Professional)
This exam is in MCQ format, and the questions are generated/rotated automatically. Sometimes, you may get odd questions. While I can't share the exact questions, here's an example to give you an idea of what to expect:
```
Which fruit below is healthy? (Apple is healthy)
- Pineapple
- Watermelon
- Apple
- Orange
```

Other than that, overall its a good exam as well :D
